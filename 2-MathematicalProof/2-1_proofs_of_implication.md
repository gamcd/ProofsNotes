## Theorem 2.1
### If the list { sit, hut, sum, W } is tight and W begins neither with “s” nor “h”, then the last letter of W is a “t”.
Proof:
Suppose { sit, hut, sum, W } is tight and W starts with neither 's' nor 'h'.
If the second letter of W is a 'u', then tightness requires d(sit, W) <= 2 so the last letter of W is a 't'. On the other hand, if the second letter of W is not a 'u', then tightness requires d(hut"", W) <= 2 so the third letter of W is a 't' in this case as well. Subsequently, the third letter of W is 't'.

## Def 2.2 
### let _ℤ_ = {... , -2, -1, 0, 1, ...} be the integers. The integer a _divides_ the integer b if there exists an integer k such that b = ak
