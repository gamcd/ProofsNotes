## Theorem 2.1
### If the list { sit, hut, sum, W } is tight and W begins neither with “s” nor “h”, then the last letter of W is a “t”.
Proof:
Suppose { sit, hut, sum, W } is tight and W starts with neither 's' nor 'h'.
If the second letter of W is a 'u', then tightness requires d(sit, W) <= 2 so the last letter of W is a 't'. On the other hand, if the second letter of W is not a 'u', then tightness requires d(hut"", W) <= 2 so the third letter of W is a 't' in this case as well. Subsequently, the third letter of W is 't'.

## Def 2.2 
### let _ℤ_ = {... , -2, -1, 0, 1, ...} be the integers. The integer a _divides_ the integer b if there exists an integer k such that b = ak

## Example 2.3
### The integer 6 divides the integer 42 because 42 = 6 · 7. The integer 8 does not divide the integer 34 because there is no integer k such that 34 = 8k 

2.4 - 2.7

## Theorem 2.4
### Let a, b and c be integers. If a divides b, then a divides bc.
Proof:
Suppose integer a divides integer b such that b = ak for some other integer k. For some other integer c, the product of b and c is equivalent to (ak)c which by associativity is a(kc) where k and c are integers. Therefore, in any case where a divides b, a will also divide the product bc.

## Theorem 2.5
### Let a, b and c be integers. If a divides b and a divides b + c, then a divides 3c.
Suppose integer a divides integer b such that b = ak, and that for some other integer c, a divides the sum of b and c where (b + c) = ak.

## Exercise 2.6
