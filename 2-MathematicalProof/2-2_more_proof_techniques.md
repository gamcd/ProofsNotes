Proofs of contraposition
[ P ⇒ Q ] ⇔ [ ~Q ⇒ ~P ]

## Theorem 2.14
### Let x be an interger if [ 8 does not divide x²-1 ], then [ x is even ].
Proof:
Proceeding by contraposition, [ suppose x is odd ]. Then x = 2k + 1 for some integer k.
Let's examine x² - 1 = (2k + 1)² - 1 = x² + 4k - 1 = 4k(k + 1).
Since k(k + 1) is even (by Theorem 2.12), 4k(k + 1) = 4(2j) for some integer j, such that x²-1 = 8j for some j.
Therefore, by contraposition, if 8 Does divide x² - 1, then x is even.

## Theorem 2.15
### Let x and y be integers. If [ xy is even ], then either [ x is even or y is even ].
Proof: 
[ Suppose x is odd and y is odd ], where x and why can be represented as 2k + 1 and 2j + 1.
xy = 4kj + 2k + 2j + 1 or 2(2kj + k + j) + 1  where k and j are arbitrary integers.
xy will always be of the form 2(2kj + k + j) + 1, so xy will always be odd.
Therefore, by contraposition, if xy is even, then either x is even or y is even.

# Subsection 2.2.2
Proofs of complementary implications
[ P ⇔ Q ]

Proof: 
1. Show P ⇒ Q
    Suppose P, 
    ... 
    Thus Q.
2. Show Q ⇒ P
    Suppose Q, 
    ... 
    Thus P.

Therefore, P ⇔ Q

## Theorem 2.16
### Let a, b and c be positive integers. The integer ac divides bc if and only if the integer a divides b.
Proof:
    Suppose ac divides bc such that bc = (ac)k for some integer k.

## Proposition 2.22
### At any Cal Poly football game there are at least two people in attendance with the same number of friends in attendance.

## Proposition 2.23
### Suppose Finn and Sloan come from a land where each person either always lies or always tells the truth. If Finn says “Exactly one of us is lying” and Sloan says “Finn is telling the truth”, then Finn and Sloan are both lying.
