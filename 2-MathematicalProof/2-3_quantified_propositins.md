# Subsection 2.3.1
Proofs of existence

## Proposition 2.25
### (∃x)(x² = 4)
Proof:
Consider x = 2
□

## CAUTION 2.26
### Not all existence proofs are constructive. Sometimes, a valid existence proof leaves us certain that some object with particular properties exists, yet leaves us with no idea what specific object it is.

## Proposition 2.27
### There exists a three-digit number less than 400 with distinct digits that sum to 17 and multiply to 108.
Proof:
Consider x = 269
□

## Proposition 2.28
### There exist irrational numbers x and y such that x + y is rational
Proof:
Consider x = π, y = -π
□

## Proposition 2.29
### There exists an irrational number r such that r<sup>√2<sup> is rational.
Proof:
    Suppose sqrt(2) is irrational.

## Proposition 2.30
### There exist integers m and n such that 7m + 2n = 1.


## Proposition 2.31
### Some two grandmothers of past or present U.S. presidents have birthdays within eleven days of one another.
