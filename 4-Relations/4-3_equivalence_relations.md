# 4.3 Equivalence relations

## Definition 4.24
### Let R be a relation on the set A. We call R an _equivalence relation_ on A if R has the following three properties:
1. ∀ a ∈ A, then (a, a) ∈ R.
    (Reflexivity)
2. If (x, y) ∈ R, then (y, x) ∈ R.
    (Symmetry)
3. If (x, y) ∈ R and (y, z) ∈ R, then (x, z) ∈ R.
    (Transitivity)

## Exercise 4.25
### Check the following relations on A = {1, 2, 3} for reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.
1. R₁ = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)} = I<sub>A</sub>
    - True
2. R₂ = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}
    - False
3. R₃ = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}
    - True, but weird

## Proposition 4.27
### The relation R on ℤ defined by R = {(x, y) ∈ ℤ × ℤ : x² = y² }
