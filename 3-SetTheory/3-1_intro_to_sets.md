# 3.1 Intro to sets

## Definition 3.1
### A _set_ is an unorderd collection of unique objects called its elements. If A is a set and x is an element of A, we write x ∈ A. Otherwise, we write x ∉ A.
Ex:
A = { 1, 2, 8, 17}
ℕ = { 1, 2, 3, ... }
ℤ = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... }
ℚ = { r ∈ ℝ | r = p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ and q != 0 }
ℝ = the set of real numbers

## Definition 3.2
### The set having no elements is called the empty set and is denoted by the Danish letter ∅.
∅ = {}

## Example 3.3
∅ = { r ∈ ℝ | r² + 1 = 0 }

## Definition 3.4
### There are certain sets of real numbers that garner special notation (a and b denote real numbers throughout):
(a, b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b}
 (the open interval from a to b)
[a, b] = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x ≤ b}
 (the closed interval from a to b)
(a, ∞) = {x ∈ R : a < x}
 (the open ray from a to infinity)
[a, ∞) = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x}
 (the closed ray from a to infinity)
(−∞, b) = {x ∈ R : x < b}
 (the open ray from minus infinity to b)
(−∞, b] = {x ∈ R : x ≤ b}
 (the closed ray from minus infinity to b)

## Definition 3.6
_subsets_
We say that A is a subset of B and write A ⊆ B,
provided each element of the set A is also an element of the set B.
That is, A ⊆ B ⇔ [x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B].
_set equality_
We say A equals B and write A = B,
provided A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.
That is, A = B ⇔ [A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A].

## Proposition 3.7
### {1, 2, 3, π} ⊆ [1, 4).

## Proposition 3.8
### ∅ = {∅}.

## Proposition 3.9
### ∅ 6∈ ∅.

## Proposition 3.10
### For every set A, ∅ ⊆ A.
Proof:
since in [x ∈ ∅ ⇒ x ∈ B] x ∈ ∅ is always false, the statement is true
