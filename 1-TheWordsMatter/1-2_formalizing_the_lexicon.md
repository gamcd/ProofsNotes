## Def 1.15:
### A _proposition_ is a statement that is either true or false
    - EX:
        1. Dr. Retsek had eggs for breakfast on the morning of his tenth birthday   - Proposition
        2. Elvis Lives                                                              - Proposition
        3. What time is it?                                                         - Not a Proposition
        4. x^2 = 4                                                                  - Needs more to be a proposition

## Def 1.18:
### Let P and Q be propositions. The _conjunction_ of P, Q denoted P ^ Q, is a new proposition that is true preciseley when P, Q are  both true

## Def 1.19:
### Let P and Q be propositions. The _disjunction_ of P, Q denoted P v Q, is a new proposition that is true when at least one of P, Q is true

## Def 1.20:
### Let P be a proposition. The _negation_ of P denoted ~P, is true precisely when P is false and vice versa
#### EX:
    - let P be "All stable lists are tight"             False
    - let Q be "Cal Poly is on semesters"               False
    - let R be "Betsy Ross was the first US president"  False
    - ~(P v (~Q))
        - False
    - (~(~(~P))) ^ (~R)
        - True
    - ((~R) v Q) ^ (P v (~Q))
        - True
