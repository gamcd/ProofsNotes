## Def 1.30:
### The _conditional sentance_ denoted P => Q, has truth table
| P | Q | P => Q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

## Exercise 1.30:
1. "If CP is on Quarters, then this room is 38-226": True
2. "If 2^2 = 4, then cal poly is on Quarters": True
3. "If 2^2 = 5, then cal poly is on Quarters": True
4. "If 2^2 = 5, then cal poly is on Semester": True
5. "If 2^2 = 4, then cal poly is on Semester": False

## Def 1.32
### Given conditional sentance P => Q, P is called the _antecedant_, Q is called the _consequent_
Here,
| P | Q | P => Q | ~P | Q v ~P |
|---|---|--------|----|--------|
| T | T | T | F | T |
| T | F | F | F | F |
| F | T | T | T | T |
| F | F | T | T | T |

## Def 1.37
### Given the conditional sentance P => Q, the _converse_ is Q => P
| P | Q | Q => P |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | T |

## Def 1.38
### Given the conditional sentance P => Q, the _contrapositive_ is ~Q => ~P)
| P | Q | ~Q => ~P | P => Q |
|---|---|----------|--------|
| T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F |
| F | T | T | T |
| F | F | T | T |
So, P => Q is equivalent to ~Q => ~P
