## Definition B.2
### Sets A and B have the same _cardinality_, written |A| = |B|, if there exists a bijection f : A → B.

## Definition B.9
### The set A is _infinite_ if there exists a one-to-one function f : ℕ → A. Otherwise, A is called finite.

## Definition B.11
### The set A is called _countable_ if there exists a one-to-one function f : A → ℕ.

## Theorem
### |ℚ| = |ℕ|
Proof: We will exhibit a 1-1 function f : ℚ → ℕ

## Working Notion
A is countably infinite if A = {a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄,...}

## Theorem ℝ is not countable (Cantor's diagonal argument)
Proof:
    Searching for a contradiction, Suppose ℝ is countable.
    With that, |ℝ| = |ℕ|.
    Knowing that |ℝ| = |(0, 1)|, there must exists a bijection f : ℕ → (0, 1).
